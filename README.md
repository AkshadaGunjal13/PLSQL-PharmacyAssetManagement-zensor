# Pharmacy Management System

## Overview

The **Pharmacy Management System** is a database application designed to manage assets, suppliers, and transactions in a pharmacy environment. This system includes tables for tracking assets (e.g., pharmaceuticals, medical equipment), managing supplier data, and recording transactions (both inbound and outbound). The application also includes triggers, stored procedures, and functions to automate tasks and ensure data integrity.

This project is implemented using Oracle PL/SQL and focuses on efficient management of pharmacy assets and transactions.

## Features

- **Asset Management**: Keep track of the inventory of assets (e.g., pharmaceuticals, medical equipment).
- **Supplier Management**: Manage supplier details such as name, contact, and address.
- **Transaction Management**: Record transactions for assets (IN for stock received, OUT for stock sold).
- **Automation with Triggers**: Automatically update asset quantities based on transaction type.
- **Procedures and Functions**: Simplified operations for adding assets, transactions, and retrieving asset details.

## Database Schema

### **Assets Table**

This table stores the assets in the pharmacy:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Assets (
    asset_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    asset_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    asset_type VARCHAR2(50),
    quantity NUMBER DEFAULT 0,
    cost_per_unit NUMBER,
    purchase_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);
